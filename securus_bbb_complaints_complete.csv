09/19/2025,Billing Issues,UnansweredMore info,06-17-2025 & 06-19-2025 I made 2 purchases 1 for inmate debit and 1 for ***** for connect. My husband was transferred of course without any knowledge for safety they cant let family know when a transfer will happen. Since he was transferred they still showed him in the system although they say they wasnt aware. They continued to collect my funds despite him not being there. I asked for a refund and they refused saying its not their fault that I put money and he wasnt there. I wonder how many others they collected funds for and never returned the funds to families or individuals.Of course they say your loved one can receive the funds back once released but if they a never get out or the release date is far way ultimately the funds will never be returned and they just committed a crime. Refund policy seems predatory. How can you say its non refundable when you know they leave or move facilities and its more than likely they move without prior notice. Its non-transferable or refund but most families dont have the funds to pay for the services and Securus aim to target the poor and incarcerated individuals.

They were directly violating their privacy policy that they ensure users is in place. I had to let them know of the situation. I had to let them and Washington ********** of Corrections of the issue. I have emails showing when I sent them copies of other peoples licenses because ********************** was overwriting mine. I have copies of at least 8 peoples licenses that had been uploaded on their behalf, but showed up on my profile. I can attest from at least Aug 5-14, 2025 I know for a fact the breach was occurring. Im sure they do not know how long it was occurring prior to me notifying them of this. I was contacting them and could not get them or DOC to listen to me. They make it so difficult to contact a human person, or to find how to contact anyone, which prolonged it even further. To date, no communication has went out, and they have not identified where my licenses are. I had 3 versions of my license on their app my maiden name which had been uploaded for almost a year, my temp license with my married name (how I found the breach in the first place), and my official license with married name. They still havent contacted me to identify where my information is. I know they were in contact with DOC as I spoke to someone in IT there who also advised that Securus came down to review it. Since then, theyre now retaliating against me and the state has placed me on a 30 day visit restriction which was due to Securus reporting me for an incident that occurred 30+ days prior to the violation. Again, Securus has not notified the community the uses the app and has not located my license. So someone may be able to log in and see my personal information like I have others. Multiple attempt to contact them have gone with no reply."

08/07/2025,Service or Repair Issues,UnansweredMore info,"Securus text connect has been down completely since 8/1/25 today being 8/7/25.  There is no indication that the system is down and when you try to contact securus via phone there is no option to speak to anyone about the text connect system only their phone lines.  I went through that route and was advised that that is correct the only option was to call them about phone lines.  I was redirected to wait on a supervisor but none was available but said I would get a call back.  That was on 8/4/25 Monday and I have yet to receive a call.  I also sent an email complaint as well on that day and today with only an acknowledgement (automated) that the complaint was received but no response.This is the only way I have of communicating with my husband instantly.  It is labeled as ""real-time chat."" It costs money per text from me and him and there is a limitation of characters in text.  I believe we should be notified when the system is down and refunded for texts that are sent when the system is down.  This causes unnecessary stress.We are paying for a service that is completely down right now since at least Friday and has been intermittent. This is the only form of somewhat instant communication we have with our loved ones so when it is down we are stuck. It causes frustration when we don't know that it is down or like it has been for weeks delayed because either we or our loved ones think something is wrong becoming worried or we spend additional money sending texts back and forth saying things like ""did you get my last text or is that ok,etc."" There is no sense of urgency when the system is down or slow to make corrections and no communication to those of us paying for the service that it is down or how long to expect it to be down. I can't call my husband if something is going on with the kids or they want their dad to call so we rely on messages to say ""hey can you please call when you are able or what do you think about this, etc.""I am very frustrated."

I've emailed them and I haven't even received any type of confirmation. As to what happened or whats going on. When I listen to the operator it says they nolonger take payments over the phone. So why did it prompt me to pay yet alone there wasn't a call after the setup as the I was informed the caller hung up. I will also like to add that there is literally no way to reach a real person.  If I had know that I'd never use the service. Because in cases of error it takes an act of congress just to get your money back.

I've called my bank they've advised they don't even see this transaction being attempted on their end. My uncle is without funds and has called me multiple times now collect knowing that he does indeed have $25 on his phone, and he cannot see it. I am very disappointed in the services. I recognize this may not matter to anyone there, but I can assure you that it does indeed matter to those of us who care about those humans, men, grandfathers, fathers, husbands, cousins, brothers, sons, uncles who are sitting waiting on funds to be added to call someone they love or for someone out here waiting on that call to make sure they're making it through another day. I for one cannot believe that I have called a myriad of times over the last three days and haven't been able to speak to a single human on your their end and continuously get hung up on by the automated system. This entire experience has been horrific. The only thing Im expecting here is that they fix the tablet and ability to add money on the inmates phones theyre a technology communications firm and yet we cannot use them to communicate with the clients theyre supposed to serve or even add money to their phones to function. How does this make any sense. Im simply trying to add funds to my loved ones account so he can call us. They didnt alert us of any issues. They didnt have a notice sent out. My uncle isnt the only one unable to get funds added its a few inmates and to say Im frustrated and disappointed is an understatement at this point.

03/22/2025,Service or Repair Issues,UnansweredMore info,"Hello, The nature of the complaint is that I had a situation which occurred where JPay intercepted $300 from my bank account back on the week of 10/11/24. The inmate did not receive the money and **** denied taking the payment from my account but my bank saw the withdraw.**** blocked my a count and the inmates account until I paid around  $324. I was told that bank account could not be used again and my card was blocked. So I use another bank to send money to the inmate. The issue is that Securus Technologjes had nothing to do with JPay so Securus has taken it upon themselves to permanently block me from using any debit  cards on my account and making me use moneygram whi h costs $4.99 to send money and then the money is not being uploaded to my phone account until 2-3 days later which is so unfair and an inconvenience.I have attempted twice which includes today, contacting Securus Technologies requesting the block to use debit cards be removed, and all they continue to tell me is that there is nothing they can do, it is the processing center which I have to report."

03/13/2025,Billing Issues,UnansweredMore info,"on 01/24/2025 i accidentally placed $70.00 on media for my incarcerated inmate but i didn't understand that this category does not go to his main spending account. In order for that I would have to go through ****. My first concern is that on securus technology app, it doesn't describe what all is incorporated in ""MEDIA"" so that i can clearly know that would not what i should be selecting. well i accidentally did, and i called right away and requested a refund. they told me they placed a ticket and it can take up to 30days. so i call a few weeks later and they say it can take up to 30 business days and then i call on 03/07/2025 and they said they still cant help me but they can have a *** call me. so i said ok and they call me on Monday 03/10/2025 to tell me that they are not going to refund me my $70 that I've been waiting like 42 days for them to refund me. so i called my inmate and on march 10th 2025 he said he make a call and it went a little longer then usual so it ate some change into the $70 portion on march 10th 2025, they day they finally decide to call me. so i asked the securus technology *** when he used it because I've been calling to have them work on this refund and they said they couldn't tell me when he used change into the $70.00, that is because it was that exact day they called me that he dipped into the funds, even still they could return the $69 and change back to me! I mentioned it would be different if this was the first time this has ever happened but its the second time! both refund requests went outside the time frame and i kept calling on that too. they told me the same thing. my concern is if they just processed it in time i would not run into these issues. especially if the category, listed what is entailed in media. or a hint saying this doesn't fund the main spendable account. seems unethical and like they are finding a way to deny claims by taking a long time intentionally to not benefit the person requesting a refund."

I've been waiting almost 3 months for them to refund the money back after I sent them my bank statement and all the evidence they needed. Nothing was getting done and every time I called I got to run around from someone with different excuses and reasons as to why I haven't got my money back.

Prisoners were only granted 4 free visits a month. In the last few days we received emails saying we could go back to paying for visits. Because their systems were down I canceled a visit and spoke to Securus who advised me that I would need to email a refund request form. I was NOT advised that it was going to take 30 days for my credits to be rectified. (Before switching to the new platform they owed me 4 video visits, which took over 4 weeks to get reissued to my credit cards.) Employees will rarely connect you to the correct department or have an actual policy (it literally depends on what employee you speak to.) When speaking to the supervisor all he could say was there was no one he directly contacts regarding this matter except administration, but will not give the number to any superiors. He says that there are no phone numbers for anyone higher up in the company and that I would need to wait 30 days to get the credit even though they acknowledge that their company was at fault.

Since January 2024, he has been experiencing difficulties with his device, particularly with the usage of prepaid stamps for communication with his pen pals.Despite having around 70 prepaid reply stamps, my husband is unable to use them effectively due to a recurring issue where Securus charges him double every time he attempts to use a prepaid stamp. This unfair practice not only results in financial losses for my husband but also creates unnecessary hurdles in his communication efforts. Additionally, when there are no stamps in his account, he is wrongly notified of insufficient funds, further complicating the situation.Over the course of this year, my husband has diligently reported these issues by submitting numerous tickets, totaling 12 ticket numbers since January 2024. Regrettably, despite his persistent efforts to seek resolution, no concrete steps have been taken to address the problem. He has even reached out to the representative on the unit, requesting to demonstrate the issue in person, but these attempts have been met with silence and inaction.The frequent dropped calls, coupled with the discrepancy in stamp usage and charging, not only impede my husband's ability to stay connected with loved ones but also highlight a serious breach of trust by Securus. Despite assurances of problem resolution, the issues persist, indicating a lack of accountability on the part of the company.I implore you to investigate this matter urgently and ensure that my husband's concerns are addressed promptly. It is unacceptable for him to be ignored and subjected to financial losses due to the inefficiency and negligence of Securus. As his spouse, I stand firmly against this mistreatment and urge for a swift and satisfactory resolution to be implemented without further delay."

Continuous dropped calls and Securus takes my 6 cents even though the call cut off after a second of getting connected. Added up, that's alot of money over time. They shouldn't be allowed to get away with this.I have contacted a supervisor over and over with no resolve. I have contacted the legal department at Securus in ********** Texas three times to try to resolve this, no response.The week of Thanksgiving 2024 he purchased a movie on the tablet to which the tablet never let him watch it.

My son is an inmate at the **************************************** in **********, ******* (******* **** *******, R44393). He was issued a tablet which worked for a period of time. It has, however, developed technical issues in the recent past including battery overheating, non-responsive controls and an inability to recharge the unit. The tablet finally failed and is currently unusable. According to the facility, he is on a list to receive a new tablet. He has also been told that there are a large number of other inmates in front of him and the facility hasnt received any new/replacement tablets in over a year. While having a tablet may seem a luxury to those unfamiliar with the situation, this is far from the case. 1.Tablets are used to purchase music and other entertainment media. To date, my son has purchased $1,000 + worth of this media that he can no longer access due to the lack of a tablet. Securus has failed to respond to requests from both my son and me for a refund since he no longer has access to the files he purchased.  **** son has an ongoing subscription from Securus to access daily news and podcasts via his tablet. He is charged for this service monthly. Without a tablet he cannot access these resources or request the subscription be cancelled.

09/24/2024,Customer Service Issues,UnansweredMore info,"The following is a list of my grievances against Aventiv H323638353530313238**H and their subsidiaries, primary H3237373538**35373632H LLC and Securus Monitoring 1. The Missouri Department of H3336323638**38333736Hions entered into a contract with Aventiv H323638353530313238**H, signed by the **** Director. We, the inmate population, had no say in this matter nor did we sign any documents entering ourselves into this contract. In fact, as a **** of the state we are not allowed to enter into any contract. 2. Aventir H323638353530313238**H charges us a ""content delivery"" fee for music purchases and a ""contact delivery"" fee plus a ""CM"" charge for movie and to show rentals as ***** as game purchases. These unlawful fees are charged to us for Aventir H323638353530313238**H to move content across a network that they own to a tablet that they also own. 3. Aventir H323638353530313238**H has a monopoly on our mail as all incoming mail besides ""privileged mail"" is received on our issued tablets. This includes photographs and cards. 4. We&#**;re forced to accept the ""Securus service terms and conditions"" in order to receive mail, access the phone from in our cells, access important MDOC literature such as the ""Offender Rulebook,"" all probation and parole information and so forth. 5. The tablets and network are very unreliable due to antiquated and inferior technology. Consequently, I&#**;m denied communication with my family and loved ones. 6. Dispute multiple ""Trouble Tickets,"" Aventir H323638353530313238**H refuses to correct, fix, repair or address the vast majority of the issues that we (the inmate population) bring to their attention. 7. It often takes 4 to 15 days for outgoing mail to be sent out and 4 to 30 days for incoming mail to be received by us. We are not offered a second option for incoming mail. 8. We are not given a refund for arbitrarily censored outgoing mail. 9. Our friends and loved ones are not given refunds for arbitrarily censored incoming mail. 10. Aventr H323638353530313238**H offer/include several application functions that do not function. These functions are part of the contract. 11. We are not allowed to print our e-messages. Without the option to print, we&#**;re without a method for record keeping. 12. Often, drafted e-messages automatically delete without prompt just minutes after being saved. These e-message drafts are not suppose to auto delete for 24 hours after being saved. 14. Movie picture quality is abysmal of best, as you often can&#**;t even make out who&#**;s who or what an object is. 15. At $0.05 per minute, phone calls are grossly over priced. 16. At $0.25 per ***** character e-message, e-messages are grossly overpriced. 17. The ""connect me"" phone app was advertised to us as a way to make phone calls from our calls, although the wifi strength is rarely strong enough to connect a call, let alone have a conversation. 18. Our phone calls are often disconnected due to tablet and/or network errors, resulting in lost money. 19. The majority of the provided applications are faulty and can not be used as advertised. 20. When we submit trouble tickets complaining of wifi issues, we will receive responses such as this one. ""Please remember with wifi y our tablet needs to be close to the wifi range of your dorm. Sometimes outside of this range the wifi is not strong or does not work."" It should be noted that the whole point of the tablet was to allow your phone and e-message services from our cells. 21. It doesn&#**;t matter where you are in the dayrooms the wifi reliability is very poor. Even directly lbeneath the wifi antenna. 22. I have not bought a game yet that doesn&#**;t have major bugs and glitches. These games are advertised as fully functioning and complete games. 23. When H3237373538**35373632H/Aventir H323638353530313238**H does refunds for faulty games and music (and it&#**;s not very often) they pro rate the value of said product(s) and only refund what they believe you&#**;re entitled to. That&#**;s if they refund you your money at all. 24. Aventir H323638353530313238**H also has a monopoly on all music, monies, books, phone services, games, tv shows and money transfers. 25. All pricing is predatory. 26. In summary, Aventir H323638353530313238**H business model and practices are plagued by fraud, false advertising, misrepresentation, constitutional violations, ethics violations and much more. I&#**;m requesting that Aventir H323638353530313238**H license to operate in the State of ******** be revoked. I&#**;m looking for $25,000 in compensatory damages for the emotional distress, mental anguish, hindered ability to communicate with media, legal representatives and loved ones. Additionally, I&#**;m seeking $50,000 in punitive damages for Aventiv H323638353530313238**H reckless indifference to my rights, ill will and desire to injure with malice. This behavior is very evident when you examine Aventir H323638353530313238**H exploitation of the incarcerated who more often than not suffer from some form of mental defect. i.e. addictive personality disorder, excessive compulsive disorder, impulsive disorders, anxiety, depression, PTSD among others. This behavior is reprehensible and egregious and must stop. Furthermore, if Aventir H323638353530313238**H is allowed to continue doing business in the State of ********, I need all of the extra fees that are added to content waived, i.e., ""Content Delivery,"" ""CM"" and other fee that exists or may exist in the future."

They offer video calls, which cost $4.95 per 20-minute call. I have signed up for two video calls, one on 05/16/2024 and one on 08/09/2024. On both of these calls, my friend showed up on time and we were both logged in and waiting for the call to start for 3-4 minutes before it began. When the call started, the quality was so terrible that I could barely make out anything he was saying. The video was blurry and the sound was so choppy that I could only hear every third word he said. I know that I'm not the only person experiencing this because they have a 1.1 star rating on Yelp out of 193 reviews. Every review is complaining about their terrible quality of services and that when you try to reach out to request a refund, they don't respond, and that their customer ********************** is non-existent. They have a monopoly on the communication industry in prisons. There is no other option to speak to loved ones, that is the only service that the prison offers. Please look into this exploitative and fraudulent company. They need to repair their video visit services. It is ridiculous that they're charging so much for these calls, especially if they don't even work as they're supposed to. I want them held accountable; it's not about the $10. Most family members of incarcerated people are facing financial troubles and they can't afford to spend $5 per 20-minute phone call, so it leaves incarcerated people without contact from the outside world and become even more isolated, which has deep and lasting societal effects."

Since we live on either coast and do long distances I can only do physical visits twice a year and most of our other visits are done through Securus video chat. In order to do that chat you must be an approved visitor on the incarcerated individuals visitor list with the *** and your name must match the name on Securus to schedule and attend a video visit. At the beginning of April I initiated a name changed since I took my husbands last name after we got married. *** changed my last name right away but Securus did not. I was told by an employee to send in a copy of my Id and Marriage certificate to provide proof of the name change. When the standard 15 day wait period passed I called to escalate the issue with a supervisor only to find out I was told the wrong information. I needed to provide my phone bill with updated name listed on the account. I was told I would have to wait the 15 day time frame again because I didnt provide the proper documentation. Even though this was a mistake made by an employee because I was told the wrong information. When trying to escalate the issue further the supervisor hung up on me. I later received an email about ten days after stating they still could not change my name because the phone number on my Securus account was not visible on the bill I sent to them. Frustrated I sent another copy with the phone number listed but yet again I have to wait another 15 days to escalate because I didnt provide proper documentation when it was a lack of communication on the employees part. I now have not seen my husband in almost two months which has led me to filing thins complaint. There has to be an easier faster way for them to fix these issues because maintaining a relationship with my loved one is on the line and especially since I spend about ******* a month with them.

04/29/2024,Customer Service Issues,UnansweredMore info,I have been using your company for a while now and have spent quite a bit of money with this company to contact my husband who is imprisoned. I made one simple mistake and on the advise of a prison employee got my bank to reject one charge. I was not aware that this would be something that would be punished so severely. I have never done this before and had no clue that this would basically make me unable to spend money with the company. I need to be able to contact my husband. I would like to have my account unflagged. I will not contest any more charges. This was one simple misunderstanding because a video visit I payed for did not show up on the facilities system. It was a simple human error and I just want to be able to spend money with you guys to message and video visit with my husband. Please consider my request. Thank you.

04/15/2024,Billing Issues,UnansweredMore info,"Basically, the Securus phone systems used in California prisons is in fact, illegally bugged for every persons call, and they do not route the calls to the person intended when someone makes a call. This goes for non-violent criminal offenders, or people supposedly calling out to other people with non-violent criminal histories or who have a history of mentally-disturbed induced criminal offenses. I would put the blame squarely on the facilities that use the services but let's be honest. They don't hire VOIP/telecommunications experts to work at prisons and prison lobbies for the most part. If they do, that's pretty interesting. If the calls are being routed incorrectly, the prison personnel might even have someone sounding like the person intended to be called answer the line from outside the prison. That is the part that would be incredibly offensive and the people doing that in the prisons would be heavily fined and possibly even fired, if not suspended from work without pay for a while. I am of course referring mostly to the supervisors and then the employees. The supervisors of these prisons have been there longer and Securus got these contracts in 2000 in **********. I hope the supervisors did not teach the employees to do this to people. Regardless, this would be a gross miscarriage of justice if Securus technologies knowingly provided a means for a few corrupt cops/police personnel to mis-route, spy or bug calls, and manipulated phone conversations for EVERYONE. If this is done to innocent people, this is horrifying. I would press charges or *** if I could, but to my knowledge, their actual headquarters is in ******. Of course. Their satellite US office is in *****, for some reason."

My inmate contacted me via phone during this same timeframe and informed me that he could see me and hear me, however I was not able to see nor hear him. After several attempts we gave up. I submitted a Securus Video Connect Credit Request Form to request a refund or credit due to this technical failure on Securus's part. Per their request form located on their website, I allowed them 5 days (today) to ""investigate"" the issue to determine whether or not they will provide me with a refund. It also indicates on their website to call for a final decision. I have attempted to call and it's impossible to speak with anyone. All prompts lead to them ending the call with absolutely no resolution because you cannot actually speak with someone nor is there the option to check the status of this request. This is not the first time I have had a failures with other video calls however my last two requests for refunds I submitted went unresponded to and were never credited. I won't accept this anymore. I will no longer sit by and allow them to manipulate people out of their money when no services are being provided. They take advantage of the fact that customers have no other options and so are forced to use their services if we want to try to stay connected to our loved ones. Please find attached photos that prove I submitted a request  2/25 - although they will not send customer's confirmation emails nor any other communication for that matter. All they do is refer us to their phone number which nobody actually picks up - only prompts are available.

Immediately apon their takeover, a multiple of ******** customers (including myself) discovered that we were not able to receive calls placed through securus. I first went to ******** to have the issue checked out and was assured that there is nothing on my phone that would prevent me from being able to get the calls. After that I called securus  multiple times, having them troubleshoot my phone. Everytime, they would tell me there was nothing wrong with my line, and they did not have a reason for the calls not coming through. Finally, a customer ********************** agent agreed to escalate my account and have the technical support team look at it. I was finally able to receive calls for almost a month after that. Starting last week though I am back to no longer being able to receive calls. I contacted securus again. They informed me that the only way to fix the situation was for me to switch cell phone providers because people all across the nation who have ******** are not able to receive calls through Securus and they don't know how to fix it. This is absolutely unacceptable. I am locked into a contract with ******** and the fact that securus cannot get the calls to connect has nothing to do with ********. That is an issue on their end that they are refusing to investigate. Meanwhile, hundreds of inmates are not able to contact their loved ones due to this.  That creates extreme emotional problems among families and inmates. Securus needs to be held accountable for this and fix their system. No one ever had this problem when GTL was the phone provider. This is the only way we have to speak to our loved ones and securus has prevented us from being able to do this. Please help us resolve this."

Since the wait over the telephone was so long I opted for a call back. The lady who called back was clearly agitated when she called before she even spoke with me. She rudely asked for my information and while I was trying to explain asked me if I was going to give her a chance to speak. I'm  going through a very hard time with my loved one and her rudeness was uncalled for. I tried to remember the email but she extremely rudely snapped no you get one chance and I knew then she was going to be to ugly to help me and I hung up. These people working for a company who assists the incarcerated should understand this is a time we need a little compassion and to show kindness.

I have attempted to register for the program and I received a message that Securus has blocked me apparently due to this outstanding bill.

Their fees are extortionate: $0.44 to send one email and an additional $0.44 for each attachment. However, my complaint is that they routinely and arbitrarily ""censor"" emails, which means that they cancel the entire message, provide no refunds, and offer no explanation as to why the message was censored. They also provide no guidance as to what is and is not acceptable, so basically they can, at their own discretion and with no accountability, simply refuse to send the message that was paid for, keep the money that was paid, leaving people like me to blindly try again and hope I've correctly identified and removed the offending material. I recently send a message that included two photos and an extra ""stamp"" for my pen pal to use. The message got censored, costing me ~$2, and they didn't even pass on the stamp to my inmate despite the fact that it was clearly unrelated to whatever led to the censoring. This is theft from an incompetent, corrupt company that only survives because it has a monopoly. I want a clear statement of what is and is not acceptable communication so I have a chance of avoiding violations, I want specific explanations of violations to demonstrate that they're not just blocking messages to drive profits by forcing people to resend messages, and I want the portions of a censored message that were not in violation to be promptly refunded.

07/27/2023,Product Issues,UnansweredMore info,"My husband is currently incarcerated at the ************************* in ********, **. Having to use Securus Technologies to be able to speak to him isn't my choice it's the only option given to families. Since my husband received his tablet in March it had been one issue after another.  I haven't had one entire phone call that was a completely clear conversation, ever.  You spend half the call saying huh and what? For a month his tablet couldn't make calls. All this time he filed to have it fixed and was ignored. I called the unit and would be told they had nothing to do with it and then I'd call Securus and be told they have nothing to do with fixing the tablets he needs to have his voice biometrics redone and he needs to file a request at the unit. All of this while explaining multiple times he'd had his voice biometrics redone and it wasn't resolving the issue.  Finally, the tablet stopped working completely and even though my husband filed multiple requests again it wasn't until i called the unit and demanded resolution did he finally get a new tablet. Now we're going on a week of dropped calls lasting 1-5 minutes while I'm being charged for the calls!  Call the unit and they say to call securus. I call securus they say the unit has to report the issue. Why?  Why can't the employees answering securus customer ********************** calls report the issue? I have been talked down to and even hung up on by securus employees. And all the money that I'm being charged for dropped calls!  And everyone is experiencing the same issues on the unit. Its a joke to try to get resolution for being reimbursed. I'm told to fill out a dropped call form that's honestly ridiculous to fill out. How about just reimbursing the dropped calls.  It should be illegal to have a monopoly on the phone provider for these prisons. If you are charging people for a product why is it asking so much for it to work properly? I'm including 5 pages worth of dropped calls! That's conveniently all I could pull up."
07/26/2023,Billing Issues,UnansweredMore info,Calls are continuously dropped I can accept a call It will immediately drop or I could be on the call and there will be silence on there for a couple minutes before it actually hangs up and I am being charged for this this happens two or three times a day securus claims is the facilities problem and the facility says it's a securus problem. I would like an adjustment to my account for the time that it sits on silent before the call disconnects and for what it charged me to connect and then disconnects immediately All these calls are on record as per a securus customer ********************** rep. *** they could see the drop calls. It would be nice if they would fix the problem instead of it just passing it on to someone else or ignoring their customers it's been hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month

There is an option to pay by card while on the line but the card inputs are not recorded and the call eventually drops. During the call it also says you can set up an online account. I've set up 3 and I have proofs for all of them. All of which I funded and still when he calls it says I have no account and it just keeps happening. I can't get my friend out of jail without speaking to him and this Securus has no customer support and I can't afford to continue spending money on accounts that don't work anyway. Please help.

The contract Securus has with Department of Corrections says Securus will refund songs that are not working and no longer available with the appropriate credits. Securus also said in 2 different Media Store messages stating Securus will refund old songs that are not working with the appropriate credits. They will not honor this and follow the contract. I want a full refund for all of these songs from artist sant-y1. Securus have told me in the past 10 support tickets that Securus will report this issue to the development team for resolution. Securus has said this since March 2023 and nothing has happened. I want my full refund of $200 because this is considered theft.

06/22/2023,Billing Issues,UnansweredMore info,"On June 21, 2023, a family member tried to call me, and by the time I entered all the credit card info and the automated messages stopped there was no one on the line; I was charged $6.74 and did not get to exchange a single word. I tried using an account I created years ago that but received a message saying the account didn't exist. Then tried creating a new account only to receive a message saying that I had to call an 800 number. I called the 800 number but there was only a limited automated help system (that did not address my issue) and no option to speak with a person. I tried searching for other numbers to call to speak with a person but there were none in which speaking with a person was an option.  A few hours later, my family member tried calling me again, and again I entered all the info, yet was unable to speak with him, and again I was charged $6.74. I called the facility to find that the only way I can speak with my brother is if I have a Securus account.Then I decided to try creating an account again with the same results as prior - I even tried resetting the old account and received a message saying there were technical difficulties. The chat system is woefully inadequate for any type of troubleshooting - tried that too.If I do not hear from someone tomorrow about a refund of $13.48 and some assistance with my issue, I will simply do a charge-back, and then put all my energy into lobbying the County to use a different vendor - it shouldn't be that difficult after I show them the BBB results and the information on other vendors that I found. In the meantime, there is no way for me to speak with my family member; this is truly insane."

On March 14th, 2023 I received a call from my loved one indicating that when he attempted to call me collect, he was told that it was restricted. I checked my account and was shown that it was closed (with a $12.03 balance still available). I promptly contacted customer ********************** four times and explained the situation. Three representatives did indeed validate that the company understood that the chargeback I issued was legitimate and that I was unfairly charged, yet despite that, they still completely locked my account and said I need to pay them back the balance of my chargeback. They have locked the debit account of my loved one from receiving funds from anyone through any means other than ************* and MoneyGram (which you need a special number to fund through, and they are nonrefundable services) and he has not been able to speak to most of his loved ones for days. Additionally, they informed me that once I paid back my ""balance"" I will never be able to use a card with them again. Additionally, I would not ever be able to message my loved one again because I will not be able to purchase stamps. Currently, Securus has blatantly stolen $100 of my money and is instead treating me like a thief and completely violating the terms of their regulatory boards.I have sent countless emails and proof to no avail."
03/14/2023,Product Issues,UnansweredMore info,"On Jan 20th 2023 I purchased 3 sets of stamps (90 each set ) to be able to contact my loved one who is incarcerated.. The first set of 90 I purchased I transferred to him. He did not receive them so I then purchased another set of 90 and transferred those to him which he received. I then purchase another set of 90 to keep for myself. So on 1/20/2023 only 180 stamps are accounted for (90 to him and 90 to me) out of the 270 I paid for. I have sent proof to the company showing the two transfers made to my loved one and they are denying that. A representative advised that she was able to see the three purchases that I made yet they still are refuse to provide me with the third set I never received, nor did my love one. I have spent thousands with this company and have dealt with the multiple outages of their services. I would hope they would do what is right and credit the 90 missing stamps."
03/14/2023,Billing Issues,UnansweredMore info,"This company refuses to assist me in transferring my information from my Jpay to Securus account (stamps and email address). I contacted them in late February to find out what was going on as I received an error message stating ""Currently we are experiencing technical difficulties processing your request. Please try again later."" I called to find out what was going on and I haven't received an email regarding linking my Jpay account to my ********************** Account as well. I sent an email when I selected Contact Us, it gave me an option to send an email. I sent an email and had not heard anything after a week. I called in and was told that I would receive a response in 3-5 business days. I had not received a response from anyone so I called in to find out what was going on. I was then told ***** business days. The representative told me it has only been 10 days. I waited until that Friday and had not received an email. I contacted them on March 13 @5:20 pm and inquired what was going on. I was advised that another email could be sent over. I told the representative someone had already done that for me. I got frustrated because I was being told different things. That representative hung up on me. I would like them to be disciplined. I used to work in customer ********************** with people whose attitudes were a lot more uglier then mine and I was hung up on. I called back to speak with a manager and got a supervisor and was told he was the only one on duty. I am signed up with Jpay and I used my same username and password and I am still receiving that same error message. The supervisor stated he could not remain on the phone with me as I attempted to access my account which I am fine with. I am still not getting an answer. I was also told to create another account using a different email address and they would work on having the stamps transferred to that account. I refuse to speak with them as this was not handled correctly the first time. Thanks for your help!"

The Securus software malfunctioned and sent me a bill for a full call, accumulating California taxes and fees. Securus does not have a customer ********************** department and there is no way to dispute the charges. No response from online complaint department, no one to speak over the phone. The public are the ones who fund the inmates for their phone time and then Securus charges us again for their errors. There needs to be accountability and this company is maliciously charging grieving families just to communicate with their loved ones."

03/10/2023,Product Issues,UnansweredMore info,This is a 3rd party company that provides phone service for incarcerated individuals. My husband has been unable to call because his calls will not connect. All his calls come thru but will immediately hang up or if I am able to answer it is dead silence. This started Friday March 3rd. I called Securus on Saturday March 4th and was provided w/ Case# ******** and was told it was my cell phone service and not them but she would send this to a higher tier for review and someone will contact me. I called ******** on the same day and they checked my line. There were no blocks  spam or any other blocks. Funny how I was receiving his calls the day prior from the same facility and phone #. I have been back & forth w/ both Securus and ******** since this past Saturday. The exact same problem has been occurring and still occurring for 8 days now. I called Securus AGAIN yesterday March 9th & per ****** the above case was closed and a new Case# ******** has been assigned & escalated as high priority to a supervisor & to allow 10/14 business days. How is this high priority when I have to wait this amount of days for a response? These people can never give me a satisfactory answer. There response is always it's my cell phone carrier!!! This is not the case because if that were the case then I would be having issues w/ ALL my other calls which I'm not! I have spent $$$$ w/ this company and this is the service they provide. I had a family emergency a few days ago and could not inform my husband and give him an update because of this situation. I'm not the only customer having problems w/ this company! I have sent numerous messages to Securus and no response or updates!!!!

Before they spent millions on installing wifi and issuing tablets for calls, the phones were half was ok. But now there is so many issues...not just one or two are being effected but the whole unit. We as family are being charged an outrageous amount for calls only to have about half our conversation understood. Also they have made it almost impossible to reach the company. I, as well as many others have reached out to the unit and the phone company only to meet dead ends. There are times my LO spends 45 minutes or more trying to get a dial tone to get out. It absolutely ridiculous that they are making millions and have a service that is effecting the lives of humans. My husband has stage 3 cancer and his time is short so these calls mean everything. Please help me and so many others with these issues. Thank you"

Securus will not reply to e-mails and will not talk to me on the phone. The only option available is to send more money.  I not only want mu $45 back but I want to see this company loses its license to serve prisoners. It is scamming the most vulnerable segment of society and their families that already are marginalized. Securus is like robbing from the dead -from beings that cannot fight back. They are a true symptom of the scamming underbody of society that leaches from the poor and underpriviledged .Some kind of class-action lawsuit should be filed against them"

02/24/2023,Service or Repair Issues,UnansweredMore info,"I deposited ****** into a securus debit account thinking that I was funding a commissary account. I was contacted by the inmate ***************************** advising me that he never received the money. I contacted securus and was advised that the all the money that I deposited went towards phone calls. I asked if ****** could be put towards phone calls and ****** towards the commissary. I was told no. I explained that he needed food and clothing more than he needed to use the phone and if the monet could be switched. I was told no but to contact my financial institution. I contacted **** of America and explained what happened advising that I did make the charges but the amount was credited to the wrong account . They opened up a claim for 300 of the 400 that I deposited. Then securus locked me out of the e-messaging and visiting accounts. I contacted securus and was advised that I would not be able to use the services until I paid back the charge back from my bank. I contacted **** of America again and explained to them what happened. They then closed out all of the claims and refunded the monies back to securus. Now I still can't use e-messaging or schedule video visits for my loved one. I contacted securus again and I was advised that I could fund both accounts through ************* in which I did. I now have credits on the accounts, I can't purchase stamps for e messaging   or still schedule video visits. I contacted securus regarding this again. I was told that they don't know why I can't purchase stamps because I have a credit and a credit card on file and that I can't arrange a video visit because I don't have a credit card on file but there system won't let me even add a credit card. I still have credit on the video call as well. I have asked to speak with someone in management several times and I keep being told that someone will call me back and in the meantime I am unable to communicate with my loved one in a normal fashion."
02/24/2023,Billing Issues,UnansweredMore info,"This is not the first time this has happened. I have been charged for several video visits that did not occur over the years. The most recent is 2/12/2023 $4.95 was charged to my bank account for a video visit that I requested with my incarcerated loved one but the prison cancelled it. So it did not occur. Securus charged me for it anyway and offered no customer ********************** response on my compliant. It shows in the attached transaction history that it was credited but this is a hoax. There is no credit to my bank account or **** le credit in their system that I can use.  There phone numbers don't even work. They are just recordings. 2/13/23 I was able to have a video visit but the quality was so poor that my inmate and I could not really see one another or have a conversation. I would like that $4.95 refunded as well. I would like to not be forced to pay 25 cents for each email or photo I send or my inmate sends. One dollar is the cost of sending a 30 second video message. And if the prison decides that the content of an email or photo is not appropriate and block it from going to my inmate, I do not get a refund. Thank you for listening."

Now when I try to go on my pad Securus wants me to acknowledge to terms and conditions and that I cannot pursue any further actions wants I acknowledge. I cannot acknowledge because if the songs I bought didn't transfer over so therefore I'm unable to use my pad. I would like to be credited the money I spent on the songs, or have all songs transferred."

Also, I never received the credits back onto my ************* account for canceling a visit due to technical errors on their website and app. I have also been overcharged for phone calls and I have paid for several phone calls upon prompt in which I did not get to talk with the person who was calling. They have been taking money away from my account as well as refusing to put it back on there. The calls are supposed to be 19 cents per minute but since I know how to add and subtract very well I can see on some days they have been charging me 21 cents per minute and sometimes up to 25 cents per minute."

It is close to impossible to get in touch with a representative. When I was finally able to connect, the hold time was above 30 minutes. That is NOT acceptable ! Since my approach did NOT work, can you please speak to a reasonable representative ? Or to a supervisor ? No email is listed anywhere on the website.

I have recently been let go from a job and waiting to start another. So when the representative asked me rudely why I haven't paid the bill I expressed and he was rude. Securus is the only platform that I can use to talk to inmates. I pit money towards that inmates account yet for some reason I still managed with a bill. Now only because this is the only platform that any inmate can use to call I'm going to pay the bill. I don't need representatives calling me harassing me and once I pay it inmates better get to writing bc I won't be using securus services no more if this how they treat their customers.

I have never had any issues with my credit card(s) for making a payment to purchase stamps to communicate via email to the inmate.  I have tried every credit card I own and system denies any credit card.  I tried to use my spouse's credit card and that does not work as well.  I have had many phone conversations and no one seems to care or want to help resolve this issue.  I do not have any abuse and/or debt owed to Securus.  All they can tell me is that I have a chargeback and can NEVER use a credit card with them again.  I believe this is an error and they have me mixed up with another Patricia Miller's account in another state.  I asked to speak to someone in charge and they won't let me .  I called most recently and the representative stated that I could go thru ********* and make a payment to Securus account and make a transaction for payment to the Securus account that is associated with my name.  I have done that and the funds were wire transferred on Nov 4 for $24.99 and the transaction reference number is #********.  The money has not been put in the account. Why?  I have sent several email messages and no response.  I have called numerous times and no resolution.  Why?  Why am I being prohibited to purchase stamps to communicate on-line thru Securus?  it appears I'm being blocked and if my credit cards do not work, nor my spouse's credit cards, and monegram does not work what is Securus doing?  Why are they not helping me resolve this issue.  It has gone on over 3 months and they don't care.  I'm seeking your assistance because apparently they are preventing me from my rights to communicate with an inmate.  Securus I feel has not helped me and won't resolve the issue."
